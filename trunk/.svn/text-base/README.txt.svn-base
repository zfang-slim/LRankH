    2DDFreqModeling - variable density acoustic modeling
    2DEFreqModeling - elastic modeling
    operators       - various SPOT operators (Splines, Interpolation, etc.)
    solvers         - non-linear optimization codes (L-BFGS, etc)
    utils           - various utility functions (running batchjobs, saving figures, etc.)
    misc            - various functions (misfit functions, io, etc.)
    iwave           - scripts for generating iWAVE parameter files
